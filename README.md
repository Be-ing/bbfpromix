# ALSA Mixer Frontend for RME Babyface Pro (FS)

In order to use this, you need to patch your kernel. The patch has been submitted upstream, but is also available from here: https://github.com/MrBollie/RME-Babyace-Pro-ALSA-Mixer-Patch

A simple make should do on this.

Use with caution! And feedback is always welcome. :)
